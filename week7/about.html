        <h1>Virginia Protectors Of American Civil Rights</h1>

        <p>Our primary goal is to bring awareness, understanding, and context
           to the continuing struggle to ensure all American men and women are
           given equal protection under the law.<br>

           This months theme supports an historical review of the African American struggle
           from systematic racism under slave law, to institutional racism under segregation, the Civil
           Rights Movement,<br> and the future hope that is left with our children to make a better world.<br>

           <br>One significant note of importance for everyone to realize and seldom mentioned, is that through
           the brutal and painful history of African Americans in this country, God allowed some of the most
           <br>courageous, humble, and generous white men and women who also risk their lives to support the plight
           of African Americans and other minorities to try to get as close to the words of the <br>Declaration Of
           Independence and the Nations Laws under the Consitution.<br>

           <br>Love will always move hate and prejudice aside, humility will always tower over pride, generousity will always prevail over 
           selfishness, faith, hope, and most imporatantly our belief in God will allow <br>our great Country to 
           continue to bring hope to people all over the world who strive for liberty, freedom, and the rule of law.</p>
